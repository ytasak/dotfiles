**difit** is a CLI tool that lets you view and review local git diffs with a GitHub-style viewer. In addition to clean visuals, comments can be copied as prompts for AI. The local code review tool for the AI era!

## ⚡ Quick Start

Try it first

```bash
npx difit  # View the latest commit diff in WebUI
```

Install and use

```bash
npm install -g difit
difit  # View the latest commit diff in WebUI
```

Enable use from AI agents

```bash
npx skills add yoshiko-pg/difit # Add the Skill to your agent
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
difit <target>                    # View single commit diff
difit <target> [compare-with]     # Compare two commits/branches
```

### Single commit review

```bash
difit          # HEAD (latest) commit
difit 6f4a9b7  # Specific commit
difit feature  # Latest commit on feature branch
```

### Compare two commits

```bash
difit @ main         # Compare with main branch (@ is alias for HEAD)
difit feature main   # Compare branches
difit . origin/main  # Compare working directory with remote main
```

### Special Arguments

difit supports special keywords for common diff scenarios:

```bash
difit .        # All uncommitted changes (staging area + unstaged)
difit staged   # Staging area changes
difit working  # Unstaged changes only
```

### GitHub PR

```bash
difit --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

`--pr` mode fetches patches by running `gh pr diff --patch` under the hood.

Authentication is handled by GitHub CLI:

1. **Login once** (recommended): `gh auth login`
2. **Token-based auth** (CI/non-interactive): set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`

#### GitHub Enterprise Server

For Enterprise Server PRs, authenticate GitHub CLI against your Enterprise host:

1. `gh auth login --hostname YOUR-ENTERPRISE-SERVER`
2. Or set `GH_HOST=YOUR-ENTERPRISE-SERVER` with `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`

### Stdin

By using a pipe to pass unified diffs via stdin, you can view diffs from any tool with difit.

```bash
# View diffs from other tools
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt | difit

# Review saved patches
cat changes.patch | difit

# Compare against merge base
git diff --merge-base main feature | difit

# Review an entire existing file as newly added
git diff -- /dev/null path/to/file | difit

# Explicit stdin mode
git diff --cached | difit -
```

Stdin mode is selected with intent-first rules:

- `-` explicitly enables stdin mode
- If positional arguments (`<target>` / `[compare-with]`), `--pr`, or `--tui` are provided, difit treats the command as Git/PR/TUI mode and does not auto-read stdin
- Auto stdin detection applies only when no explicit mode is selected and stdin is a pipe/file/socket

| `--include-untracked` | false     | Automatically include untracked files in diff (only with `.` or `working`) |
| `--keep-alive`        | false     | Keep server running after browser disconnects (stop manually with Ctrl+C)  |

## 💬 Comment System

difit includes a review comment system that makes it easy to provide feedback to AI coding agents:

1. **Add Comments**: Click the comment button on any diff line or drag to select a range
2. **Edit Comments**: Edit existing comments with the edit button
3. **Generate Prompts**: Comments include a "Copy Prompt" button that formats the context for AI coding agents
4. **Copy All**: Use "Copy All Prompt" to copy all comments in a structured format
5. **Persistent Storage**: Comments are saved in browser localStorage per commit

### Comment Prompt Format

```sh
src/components/Button.tsx:L42   # This line is automatically added
Make this variable name more descriptive
```

For range selections:

```sh
src/components/Button.tsx:L42-L48   # This line is automatically added
This section is unnecessary
```

## 🤖 Calling from Agents

You can install the following Skill to request reviews from users with difit.

```sh
npx skills add yoshiko-pg/difit
```

After an agent edits code, it will start the difit server.

## 🎨 Syntax Highlighting Languages

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, Markdown
- **Shell Scripts**: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.fish`
- **Backend Languages**: PHP, SQL, Ruby, Java, Scala, Perl
- **Systems Languages**: C, C++, C#, Rust, Go
- **Mobile Languages**: Swift, Kotlin, Dart
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (HCL)
- **Others**: Python, Protobuf, YAML, Solidity, Vim script

## 🔍 Auto-collapsed Files

difit automatically identifies and collapses certain files to keep your view clean:

- **Deleted files**: Removed files are auto-collapsed since they don't require close review
- **Generated files**: Auto-generated code is collapsed by default. This includes:
  - Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, etc.)
  - Minified files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`)
  - Source maps (`*.map`)
  - Generated code:
    - Orval (`*.msw.ts`, `*.zod.ts`, `*.api.ts`)
    - Dart (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`)
    - C# (`*.g.cs`, `*.designer.cs`)
    - Protobuf (`*.pb.go`, `*.pb.cc`, `*.pb.h`)
  - Frameworks:
    - Ruby on Rails (`db/schema.rb`)
    - Laravel (`_ide_helper.php`)
    - Gradle (`gradle.lockfile`)
    - Python (`uv.lock`, `pdm.lock`)
  - Generic generated files (`*.generated.cs`, `*.generated.ts`, `*.generated.js`)
  - Content-based detection:
    - Files containing `@generated` marker
    - Files containing `DO NOT EDIT` header
    - Language-specific generated headers (Go, Python, etc.)

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (with hot reload)
# This runs both Vite dev server and CLI with NODE_ENV=development
pnpm run dev

# Build and start production server
pnpm run start <target>

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run typecheck, lint, and format
pnpm run check
pnpm run format
```

### Development Workflow

- **`pnpm run dev`**: Starts both Vite dev server (with hot reload) and CLI server simultaneously
- **`pnpm run start <target>`**: Builds everything and starts production server (for testing final build)
- **Development mode**: Uses Vite's dev server for hot reload and fast development
- **Production mode**: Serves built static files (used by npx and production builds)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **CLI**: Commander.js for argument parsing with comprehensive validation
- **Backend**: Express server with simple-git for diff processing
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub CLI (`gh pr diff --patch`) for PR patch retrieval
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with GitHub-like dark theme
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Prism.js with dynamic language loading
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests with co-located test files
- **Quality**: oxlint, oxfmt, lefthook pre-commit hooks

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 21.0.0
- Git repository with commits to review
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for `--pr` mode
